My name is Robert. I am anthropologist. I hate others! Normally, I say, "Others are fools!", not because I trully hate them. Some people I hate are,
1. Idiotic People
2. Drunkards
	a. Always Drunk
	b. Semi-drunk
Sometimes I think, "Hell! (Real Hell/Heaven)" and at other times, 'Hell! ("Life is hell: not really")'
